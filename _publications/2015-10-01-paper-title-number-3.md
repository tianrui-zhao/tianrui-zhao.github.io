excerpt: 'This paper examines the social and political impact of China’s imperial examination system (Keju) from the Song Dynasty onward. As the primary channel for elite recruitment, the system not only determined status and income but also structured the relationship between the state, elites, and local society. The Mongol Yuan Dynasty’s abolition of the exams in the thirteenth century created a natural experiment that severed the link between local elites and the central state. Using historical data and a generalized difference-in-differences design, the study finds that regions with more Jinshi degree holders in the Song Dynasty experienced higher rates of rebellion during the Song–Yuan transition, reflecting the substitution of local elites for state authority. The results suggest that the examination system shaped governance both in the short run—by maintaining state–elite integration—and in the long run, by influencing the formation of clan- and family-based local governance. The findings highlight the enduring significance of institutional design, the transformation of China’s social structure between the Song and later dynasties, and the lasting cultural legacy of the imperial examination system.'
