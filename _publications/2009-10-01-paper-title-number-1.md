excerpt: ' Local Gentries were the key groups of local governing in the imperial China，their contributions extended to the Republic period，after the abolishment of Civil Service Entrance Exam System(Keju). Using the unique data of Shandong province，we address that the gentries who had required the titles through Keju still had a positive effect on the publish goods providingin the Republic of China. Furthermore，the upper gentries’ influences were long-lasted compared to the lower gentries. Heterogeneous factors like clans’ support gave less incentives for gentries to exert，while the establishment of missionary schools gave the lower gentries opportunity to follow the modern public utilities. Such elites’ governance could replace the efforts of local governments to some extents. This essay shows that it is important to arise attentions to the elites’ class during the local governing.'
