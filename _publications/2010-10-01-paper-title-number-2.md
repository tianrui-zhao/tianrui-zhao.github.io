excerpt: 'This paper examines the impact of social heterogeneity and conflict threats on the size of government. Social heterogeneity, as an embedded layer of institutional development, reflects the distribution of actual power. It drives the emergence of internal conflict threats and shapes the trade-offs in national institutional design, particularly in the choice of the number and scale of governments. Building on the institutional economics framework of power distribution and institutional change, and drawing on a theoretical model of regional government formation, this study employs a comparative historical institutional analysis of Ming–Qing China and Edo Japan. We demonstrate that social heterogeneity and conflict threats led states to establish a larger number of governments of smaller scale. In China, the civil service examination and the bureaucratic system reduced internal social heterogeneity within the state, whereas under Japan’s Tokugawa shogunate system, stronger interregional heterogeneity and greater internal conflict threats prevailed. This resulted in divergent historical patterns of governmental organization between the two countries. The findings of this paper provide both a theoretical explanation and historical evidence for understanding institutional change and the formation of governance structures, while also offering new insights into the study of state governance in the contemporary era.'
