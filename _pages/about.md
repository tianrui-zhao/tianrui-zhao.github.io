My name is Tianrui Zhao, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Institute of Japan Studies, Nankai University. My research lies at the intersection of political economy, economic history, institutional economics, and cliometrics. I am particularly interested in how state capacity, social conflicts, and institutional change shaped long-term development, with a focus on comparative perspectives from China, Japan, and Europe.
